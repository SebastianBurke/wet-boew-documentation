Removal of trailing slash for [void elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) (self-closing tags) located in the head of Canada.ca templates.

## Summary

* **Design decision number:** 15
* **Expert:** @Ricokola
* **Submited:** 2022-11-16
* **Validated:** by @[username] on YYYY-MM-DD
* **Status:** Approved on YYYY-MM-DD
* **Type:** HTML5 Markup validation

## Scope

In web content, avoiding the usage of any trailing slashes for void elements (self-closing tags) to prevent HTML validation info messages. 

## Issue

Receiving HTML validation info messages when validating a page which include void elements (self-closing tags).

## Recommendation

Since trailing slashes are no longuer requierd nor recommended for void elements (self-closing tags) in HTML5, we are recommending removing trailing slashes for every void elements (self-closing tags) such as the ```<meta >```, ```<link >```, ```<img>```,```<input>```, ```<hr>``` and other [void elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) found in the ```<head>``` section of every Canada.ca templates.

### Deprecated

Previously mandatory in XHTML, trailing slashes are now optional and even more, they are strongly not recommended for void elements (self-closing tags) in HTML5.

### Migration

Remove the slash at the end of every void elements (self-closing tags) located inside the head and global footer of every Canada.ca templates.

#### Example

Should:
```HTML5
<meta charset="utf-8">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo">
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca">
<hr>
```

Was:
```XHTML
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html"/>
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo"/>
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca"/>
<hr/>
```

## Test

Run the [W3 Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) on a Canada.ca page where the slashes have been removed from void elements (self-closing tags) located in the head or global footer sections and expect no info warning messages related to trailing slash.

### Nu validation

[Canada.ca Home page (English).](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen.html)

**Expected result:**

To **not** get the following info warning message:

> Info: Trailing slash on void elements [has no effect](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-in-void-element-start-tags-do-not-mark-the-start-tags-as-self-closing) and [interacts badly with unquoted attribute values](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-directly-preceded-by-unquoted-attribute-values).

## Evidence

The [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) states to <strong>no use</strong> a trailing slash to mark start tags as self-closing.

The [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) states that you can use a trailing slash in a void-element start tag for literally any purpose except to mark the start tag as self-closing.

So, for example, the following are all acceptable reasons for using a trailing slash in a void-element start tag:
* I use a trailing slash because I like how it looks.
* I use a trailing slash because I run my HTML markup through a formatting tool that’s hardcoded to add trailing slashes to all void-element start tags, without any option for me to prevent the tool from doing that.
* I use a trailing slash because I write a lot of JSX code, and JSX requires the trailing slash — without any option for me to prevent JSX from doing that — so for consistency with what I’m accustomed to in JSX, I follow that same style in actual HTML documents.

<strong>Ref:</strong> [W3C Validator Wiki Github - Trailing slashes in void-element start tags do not mark the start tags as self-closing](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-in-void-element-start-tags-do-not-mark-the-start-tags-as-self-closing)

When learning about HTML, teaching about HTML, and designing HTML tools, it’s important to have and promote the right mental model about how HTML actually works.

And the way HTML works is that there’s [a discrete set of void elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements), hardcoded into HTML parsers, and people who write HTML must learn and remember which elements those are — without any trailing slash needing to be added to those elements to indicate they are special.

### Background

The reason a trailing slash was used on void elements (self-closing tags) in the first place for conforming with XHTML markup previously used for Canada.ca templates. In HTML5, trailing slashes on void elements(self-closing tags) are now optional and strongly discourage.

### Research and findings

* Nu HTML Checker from [The W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org) flags trailing slashes on void elements(self-closing tags) as info warnings. Although there are not restraining the page to render properly, since HTML5, it's strongly recommended to not make use of them anymore.
* [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Document_Type) recommends using self-closing tags (void elements) without any addition of trailing slashes.
* Trailing slash can [interfere with unquoted attribute values](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-directly-preceded-by-unquoted-attribute-values).
* The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) seems to have a preference of keeping trailing slashes for self-closing tags (void elements) based on the fact that it makes the document structure clearer for novice readers and because the code formatter [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) seems to add trailing slashes to self-closing tags (void elements) when cleaning the code, but on another note, they also said that self-closing tags do not exist in HTML.
* The [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) in its HTML syntax, states to not include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
* The [GoCardless HTML style guide](https://github.com/gocardless/html-style-guide) doesn’t include a forward-slash on void elements.
* In the [Learn HTML - document structure](https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure/) section of the [web.dev](https://web.dev/), examples that have void elements (self-closing tags) don’t use the end forward slash.
* As stated in the [MDN Github issue #20523](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/20523), "Trailing slashes for empty elements seem no longer recommended because they're unnecessary and slow things down".
