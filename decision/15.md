How to use SVG image in a web page.

## Summary

* **Design decision number:** 15
* **Expert:** @Ricokola
* **Submited:** 2022-11-15
* **Validated:** by @[username] on YYYY-MM-DD
* **Status:** Approved on YYYY-MM-DD
* **Type:** HTML5 Markup validation

## Scope

In web content, avoiding the usage of any trailing slashes for self-closing tags to prevent HTML validation info errors. 

## Issue

Avoiding HTML validation info errors when using void elements (self-closing tags).

## Recommendation

Since trailing slashes are no longuer requierd nor recommended for void elements (self-closing tags) in HTML5, we are recommending removing trailing slashes for every void elements (self-closing tags) such as the ```<meta >```, ```<link >``` and other void elements found in the ```<head>``` of every Canada.ca templates.

### Deprecated

Previously mandatory in XHTML, trailing slashes are now optional and even more, they are more and more strongly not recommended for void elements (self-closing tags) in HTML5.

### Migration

Remove the slash at the end of every void elements (self-closing tags) located inside the head and global footer of Canada.ca templates.

#### Example

Should:
```HTML5
<meta charset="utf-8">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo">
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca">
<hr>
```

Was:
```XHTML
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html"/>
<img src="/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/sig-blk-en.svg" alt="Government of Canada" property="logo"/>
<input id="wb-srch-q" list="wb-srch-q-ac" class="wb-srch-q form-control" name="q" type="search" value="" size="34" maxlength="170" placeholder="Search Canada.ca"/>
<hr/>
```

## Test

Run the [W3 Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) on a Canada.ca page where the slashes have been removed from void elements (self-closing tags) located in the head or global footer.

### Nu validation

[Canada.ca Home page (English).](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen.html)

**Expected result:**

To **not** get the following info error:

> Trailing slash on void elements [has no effect](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-in-void-element-start-tags-do-not-mark-the-start-tags-as-self-closing) and [interacts badly with unquoted attribute values](https://github.com/validator/validator/wiki/Markup-%C2%BB-Void-elements#trailing-slashes-directly-preceded-by-unquoted-attribute-values).

## Evidence

N/A?

### Background

The reason a trailing slash was used on void elements (self-closing tags) in the first place for conforming with XHTML markup previously used for Canada.ca templates. In HTML5, trailing slashes on void elements(self-closing tags) are now optional and strongly discourage.

### Research and findings

* Nu HTML Checker from [The W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org) flags trailing slashes on void elements(self-closing tags) as info warnings. Although there are not restraining the page to render properly, since HTML5, it's strongly recommended to not make use of them anymore.
* [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Document_Type) recommends using self-closing tags (void elements) without any addition of trailing slashes.
* Trailing slash can interfere with unquoted attribute values.
* The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) seems to have a preference of keeping trailing slashes for self-closing tags (void elements) based on the fact that it makes the document structure clearer for novice readers and because the code formatter [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) seems to add trailing slashes to self-closing tags (void elements) when cleaning the code, but on another note, they also said that self-closing tags do not exist in HTML.
* The [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) in its HTML syntax, states to not include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
* The [GoCardless HTML style guide](https://github.com/gocardless/html-style-guide) doesn’t include a forward-slash on void elements.
* In the [Learn HTML - document structure](https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure/) section of the [web.dev](https://web.dev/), examples that have void elements (self-closing tags) don’t use the end forward slash.
* As stated in the [MDN Github issue #20523](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/20523), "Trailing slashes for empty elements seem no longer recommended because they're unnecessary and slow things down".
