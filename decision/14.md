The following is an updated and improved version of the [Design Decision #3 about WET versioning API](3.html). It provides more details about what is versioned for the wet-boew product, GCWeb product and GCWeb Jekyll product.

The [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) is followed and applied.

## Versioned

Below are the items of our product that we are monitoring and illustrating changes via our version number.

### WET-BOEW

* Product, excluding its deployment file structure
* Components

Measured:
* Component list
* Layout
* Style
* Semantic
* Interaction pattern
* Configuration
* Static data value or its associated variable name
* Schema of the component variable data
* Component dependencies

Always a patch:
* Provisional feature

Excluded:
* Templates
* Context of use

Audience: Web author of the wet-boew product in a static server side environment.


### GCWeb

* Product, excluding its deployment file structure
* Components
* Templates

Measured:
* Component list
* Layout
* Style
* Semantic
* Interaction pattern
* Configuration
* Static data value or its associated variable name
* Schema of the component variable data
* Component dependencies
* Change in wet-boew dependencies components that require author to re-edit or provide new stable features for their page main content

Always a patch:
* Dependency to wet-boew
* Provisional feature
* Méli-mélo compilation
* Thématique feature

Excluded:
* Context of use

Templates:
* Fully in scope:
	* Baseline template and generic template
	* Widely used template
* Identified at most as a minor change with a breaking change when:
	* Moderately used and accompanied with an official communication out explicitly identified in the release notes
* Identified at most as a patch change with a breaking change when:
	* Limited use with all its active instances explicitly listed in its corresponding template documentation.

Where:
* Instance: Measured by the number of instances found on Canada.ca and by feedback received.
* Widely: There is more than 500 instance or reported widely used by various departments.
* Moderated: There is less than 750 instance or changes on Canada.ca are fully managed and applied by Principal Publisher.
* Limited: There is a few instance which are all explicitly listed in its corresponding template documentation.

Audience: Web author creating pages with the GCWeb product in a static server side environment.


### GCWeb Jekyll

* Product

Measured:
* List of includes and its purpose
* List of layout and its purpose
* Front-matter configuration
* Site core configuration
* Jekyll component configuration
* Change in component that require author to re-edit or provide new stable features for their page main content

Audience: Web author that create pages with the GCWeb Jekyll theme.

## Feature removal (Deprication)

Deprecated feature/code will last or remain functional for at least one (1) year from when it was formally deprecated. It might not render exactly the same but an equivalent version would remain functional. After that period, its removal would be identified by a major version as specified by the semantic versioning API.

For example, site that was using GCWeb (before v5.0) with the pre-2019 mega menu + breadcrumbs and haven't changed their HTML markup was compatible with GCWeb until version v11.0.0 which was released on May 2022.

## Measures definition

Short description how the measured items are measured


### Layout (ex. Wireframe)

Defined by how the semantic or inner component are organized among others within a component. Multiple layout can be supported for the same component. A layout can contain sub-layout which its own set of configuration.

* **Major layout change:** When a defined sub-layout is removed or reorganized. Merging two sub-layout is considered reorganized.
* **Minor layout change:** When a new layout variant is added.
* **Patch layout change:** N/A

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

* **Major:** When a defined sub-layout is removed or a reorganization that require web author/web developer to update their existing pages.
* **Minor:** When a new layout variant is added.
* **Patch:** A reorganization that can be applied without changing anything exception of implementing (installing) the updated library. Like when the changes is fully managed by the javascript library.

Example of observable:
* Wireframe
* Rendered HTML that leverage a CSS positioning mechanism (ex. grid system)


### Style (ex. CSS):

Define the visual aesthetic of a component.

* **Major style change:** Significant changes that change the meaning of the component or/and directly imply a major change in another component composition (like Layout, Semantic...).
* **Minor style change:** The addition of a new styles in order to visually enhance the component based on addition of a new configuration.
* **Patch style change:** Update to an existing style or an addition that don't imply a new configuration or an addition that enhance the component with no change in meaning of the component.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

* **Major:** A removal or a change of CSS class name that provide meaning and require a web author/web developer intervention to update the published content. A style that impact the published content to be reviewed, re-architect, re-organized or re-published to avoid breaking change in the communication (ex. web page). The removal of a styled configuration that is repurposed to a new component or guidance that are updated in a matter to deprecate the use of such configuration.
	For example, increasing the font size from 16px to 20px considerably impact campaign page that are tightly designed to use all the available space without impacting the layout of the promotional content.

* **Minor:** The addition of a new style or a new class name that support a new configuration to be used by an author.
* **Patch:** Change that can be applied without changing anything exception of implementing (installing) the updated library. That means the changes is fully managed by the library.
	For example, the visual change for the alert component where the alert in a coloured box (Bootstrap 3) is now change to be a large left coloured border. CSS change (style and class name) that was designed for and only used programaticaly.

Example of observable:
* CSS class name and SASS rules. (Only the ones that was designed to be use by an author to customize the component.)
* Textual description of the style itemized


### Semantic (ex. HTML):

Provide a meaning of the dynamic data (schema) and static data contained, managed and visible through the component.

* **Major change:** Removal of a dynamic data piece defined with semantic
* **Minor change:** Addition of a dynamic data piece defined with semantic
* **Patch change:** Not applicable

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

* **Major:** Removal of an HTML element and/or HTML attribute/value by the users
* **Minor:** Addition of HTML element and/or HTML attribute/value by the users
* **Patch:** Removal of an HTML element or attribute that don't impact any previous semantic. In order word the previous HTML markup used for coding the component can stay the same, no change required by the users. Or any change (removal, addition, update) in HTML markup that are generated and injected by the javascript.

Example of observable:
* HTML markup ordered and excluding generic element
* Dynamic data item which are link to a semantic tag


### Interaction pattern (ex. Functional event listing):

Definition of the events supported by component.

* **Major change:** Removal of an interaction definition or major remodel of an existing interaction that require users to review how the component is used in their content.
* **Minor change:** Addition of an interaction
* **Patch change:** Refining the interaction definition or remodel without requiring users intervention.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

(This include Javascript callback, it exposed name and list of parameters, where third party application can establish a communication with the component. For example an event name or a globally exposed function with a set of parameters.)

* **Major:** Removal of interaction that require to update the corresponding HTML markup, like removing an HTML button or a callback.
* **Minor:** Interaction pattern that require the user to add a flag in their HTML markup or specify a new configuration in order to activate the continuation. The addition of a new callback.
* **Patch:** Update of the Javascript code where it don't require any change by the users (web author). Removal of an interaction where the javascript is applying a workaround solution to avoid a change by the users on their existing published content. The addition of an interaction where the HTML markup necessary for the interaction is injected and fully managed via javascript code.

Example of observable:
* Functional event listing
* List of CSS selector identifying the controller in the HTML markup
* List of callback to interact with the component via code.
* Signature of a function exposed externally through the `wb` global object

### Context of use (ex. Guidance):

* **Major change:** Removal of a practice requiring the user to review and change or adapt their content. Like restricting the scope of use for a component.
* **Minor change:** Addition of a practice where it expand the scope of the component.
* **Patch change:** Clarification in the context of use, without requiring the intervention of the user to rethink their published work.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

* **Major:** Not applicable but it might imply a change in the configuration and/or in the interaction pattern.
* **Minor:** Not applicable but it might imply a change in the configuration and/or in the interaction pattern.
* **Patch:** Not applicable but it might imply a change in the configuration and/or in the interaction pattern.

Example of observable:
* Guidance

### Configuration (ex. Customization description):

Configuration that transform or adapt the plain component to better meet the user need. Providing a configuration should be optional and when it is required it must provide/define default value.

* **Major change:** Removal of a configuration name or a change in the default value that require a change by the users.
* **Minor change:** Addition of a new configuration which require somehow to be activated by the user.
* **Patch change:** Removal of a configuration that don't break the component neither require the user to make update at their published work.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

(This include the configuration technical name used in a JSON configuration file or in HTML attribute or as a CSS flag in order to configure the component.)

* **Major:** Removal of a configuration or a change in its default value which impact the component behaviour/state and require a user intervention in their published work.
* **Minor:** Addition of a new configuration.
* **Patch:** Removal of a configuration with is managed through a workaround to prevent updating the user to update their published work.

Example of observable:
* Customization description and default value


### Static data (ex. i18n text string):

Stateless text used by the component except when changing the language. i18n means internalization.

* **Major change:** Removal or rewrite of a i18n text string. Addition of a required i18n text string in the component.
* **Minor change:** Addition of an optional i18n text string
* **Patch change:** Removal of a i18n text string but if kept it don't negatively impact the published work and so no change required by the user.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

(The key identifying a i18n text string is monitored and not the i18n text value as is. Except if it is added as a text node in the HTML markup of the component which belong to semantic component composition.)

* **Major:** Removal or addition of an i18n text string that impact published work. Like through its plugin configuration.
* **Minor:** Addition of an optional i18n text string
* **Patch:** Addition or removal of i18n text string but where a workaround is managed through javascript or CSS without impacting the published work of the user.

Example of observable:
* i18n text string
* unlocalized key identifying a i18n text string

### Schema (ex. Shape graph; data layer):

Stateful text or data to deliver information or user experience by using the component

* **Major change:** Removal of a data or the addition of new pieces of data required by component which require the intervention of the user in their published work.
* **Minor change:** Addition of an optional data.
* **Patch change:** Change of a data piece from static to dynamic that don't require any change by the user.

Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:

* **Major:** Idem
* **Minor:** Idem
* **Patch:** Idem, but removal or addition that is fully managed through javascript or CSS without impacting the published work of the user.

Example of observable:
* Shape graph
* List of variable

### Component essential dependencies (ex. List of major versioned component):

* **Major change:** Removal of essential dependencies if the user need to review and adapt their published work.
* **Minor change:** Addition of new dependencies that provide new configurable feature requiring the user to activate it.
* **Patch change:** Update of the dependencies without breaking any existing published work. Removal and addition that require no intervention from the user.


Example with WET-BOEW and GCWeb:
* **Major**: Idem
* **Minor**: Idem
* **Patch**: Removal where the library are implementing a work around that are not breaking existing published work.

Example of observable:
* List of major versioned component
